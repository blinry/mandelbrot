        <h1>A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Mandelbrot Set</h1>

        <p>Maybe you've seen an image of the Mandelbrot Set before. It's trippy, it's wonderous, it's beautiful. Here it is, have a look:</p>

        <div class="demo" id="plain">
            <p>Click to zoom.</p>
        </div>

        <p>So, you just zoomed in <span id="zoomcount"></span>. If every human on earth did that, about <span id="zoompersons"></span> of them would end up at your location. <span id="zoomremark"></span></p>

        <p>But what does this image mean? How is it constructed?</p>

        <h2>What is the Mandelbrot Set?</h2>

        <!--

        <div class="demo" id="real">
            <p>Drag the flag.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Boring, right? Yeah. But what if we allow our numbers to go *up*, as well?</p>
        -->

        <p>To explain, consider the following situation: You have a bunny, and a flag. You can place the flag everywhere you want, while the bunny has its own free will. It's still asleep... z z Z Z Z.</p>

        <div class="demo" id="complex">
            <p>Drag the flag around. No surprises here.</p>
        </div>

        <!--<p>Now the number you select has a red, horizontal component, like before, but also a blue, vertical one. Numbers like these are called... *complex numbers*! AAAAAAAAHHHH! Wait, let me tell you a secret: *whisper* They are not totally not scary at all! When adding two of them, you just put their arrows together and BAM! You get their sum! (DEMO HERE)</p>

        <p>The only thing that's a little weird about them is how multiplication works. You know how you can *square* a normal number? Multiplying it by itself? Like, saying 3^2, and it means 3*3? Well, you can do the same thing to complex numbers. Have a look:</p>-->
        <p>Ah, the bunny woke up! The first thing it will always do is walk to the position of the flag. We call this the *first step*. All steps after that consist of two movements: First, it will *hop*! The bunny has a very particular way of hopping: It looks at the angle it has to the right-direction and hops in such a way that its angle doubles. It also looks at the distance to its sleeping position and hops so that its distance to it *squares*. Intuitively, if its distance to its sleeping position is less than 1, it will hop a little bit closer, and if the distance islarger than 1, it will hop a little bit farther away.</p>

        <div class="demo" id="square">
            <p>Pull the step slider up. Step 1 is the initial walking. Step 2 is the hop! Then drag the flag around.</p>
        </div>

        <!--<p>Except that this looks like a broken clock with fat, ugly handlebars, what happens? (To get the square of a complex number, you double its angle to the x-axis and square its length. ADD THESE MEASURES TO THE DEMO)</p>-->

        <p>And after that, it will walk again, in the same direction and distance it initially walked towards the flag:</p>

        <div class="demo" id="step">
            <p>Pull the slider up. Step 3 is another walking.</p>
        </div>

        <p>And NOW the exciting stuff happens! What if we repeat this process? After calculating our c^2+c, we square it *again*, and add c *again*? (PROBABLY NEEDS AN INBETWEEN DEMO) And do this forever and ever and ever? Look:</p>

        <div class="demo" id="iteration">
            <p>Move ya mouse, yo! Can you find a spiral? A star? A triangle?</p>
        </div>

        <!--
        <p>Whaaaat. Crazy patterns everywhere!</p>
        <p>If you play with the demo again, you can see that for some starting points, the blue path runs away, off-screen. And for others, it swirled around and stayed on-screen. In the next demo, you can click and scribble. If the path at the current mouse position leaves the screen, we will color the starting point red, otherwise black.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <p>Scribble, like tracing a coin behind a sheet of paper. <button type="button" id="scribble-reset">Reset</button></p>
            <canvas id="scribble">
        </div>

        <p>Why, HELL~O! You drew yourself a teeny tiny Mandelbrot set!</p>

        <p>Let's add more color. So far, we only used red (for when the path leaves) and black (for when the path stays). Let's say, when the path leaves after one step, we'll color that pixel X. When it leaves after two steps, we'll color it X. And so on. (ADD VISUALIZATION OF THE PALETTE) Try it:</p>

        <div class="example">
            <p>Scribble. <button type="button" id="color-reset">Reset</button></p>
            <canvas id="color">
        </div>

        <p>And that's all there is to it! Repeated application of a very simple rule, leading to incredibly complex detail.</p>

        <p>Here's the last demo for now, which does all the drawing for you, and where you can zoom in. This one has a lot to explore.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <p>Click to zoom. Middle-click to zoom out. <button type="button" id="zoomiter-reset">Reset</button></p>
            <canvas id="zoomiter">
        </div>

        <p>Some fun things you can try:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>What happens to the path at the centers of the outer "bulbs"?</li>
            <li>Can you find out which period numbers are connected to each bulb? Do you see a relation to the "antennas" extending outward from that bulb?</li>
            <li>Zoom in on one of the bulbs. What happens to the path at the centers of its sub-bulbs?</li>
            <li>What is the period of the bulbs going "outward"? What happens if you follow a number of them?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>(HERE BE DRAGONS) Lorem ipsum Mandelbrot sit amet!</p>
